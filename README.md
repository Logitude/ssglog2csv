# Starting Strength Gyms Logbook to CSV Converter

Steps to use on a desktop or laptop computer:

1. Download and install Python for your platform from https://python.org (if
necessary).

2. Download `ssglog2csv.py` by right-clicking on [this link](ssglog2csv.py?raw=1)
and choosing "Save link as..."

3. Go to https://app.ssgyms.com/logbook and log in.

4. While at your logbook page, press CTRL+S (or equivalent on your
keyboard), and where it says "Save as type:", select "Webpage, complete" and
save. (Tested on Firefox and Chrome.)

5. Locate the `.htm` file you just saved as well as the `ssglog2csv.py` file.

6. Drag and drop the `.htm` file onto the `ssglog2csv.py` file. They don't need
to be in the same location.

7. Your new `.csv` file will be created next to your `.htm` file.

Enjoy!
